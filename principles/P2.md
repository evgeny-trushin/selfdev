# P2: Random Entry Point

**Category:** Lateral Thinking Principles

Each perspective starts from a different "entry point" into the codebase:
- **User**: Starts from the end user's first interaction and works backward to implementation
- **Test**: Starts from edge cases and works toward happy paths
- **System**: Starts from infrastructure dependencies and works toward application logic
- **Analytics**: Starts from user outcomes and business metrics and works toward causes
- **Debug**: Starts from symptoms (failed integrations, unexpected state, deployment failures) and works toward root causes
