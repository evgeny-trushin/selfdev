# Increment 0003: Evolutionary Tracking

**Requirement ID:** R3  
**Status:** TODO

## Description

The system must:
- Record fitness scores per generation
- Detect regressions between generations
- Expose history for trend analysis

## Related Principles

- [E1 — Small Mutations](../principles/E1.md): Prefer many small changes over few large ones
- [E2 — Selection Pressure](../principles/E2.md): Only accept changes that improve fitness
- [E3 — Memory](../principles/E3.md): Track which prompts led to improvements
- [B4 — Feedback Loops](../principles/B4.md): Negative feedback for stability, positive for growth
- [M3 — Transparency](../principles/M3.md): All decisions are logged and explainable

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Fitness scores are recorded per generation
- [ ] Regressions between generations are detected
- [ ] Historical data is exposed for trend analysis
