# Increment 0010: Performance

**Requirement ID:** N1  
**Status:** TODO

## Description

- Analysis should complete within 30 seconds
- Minimal memory footprint
- No external API dependencies for core function

## Related Principles

- [P3 — Escape Patterns](../principles/P3.md): If code is clean but loads slowly, system perspective flags performance
- [B1 — Morphogenesis](../principles/B1.md): Performance issues are high-priority in the gradient
- [SYS — System Perspective](../principles/SYS.md): Performance bottleneck detection

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Full analysis completes within 30 seconds
- [ ] Memory usage stays within reasonable bounds
- [ ] No external API calls are required for core analysis
